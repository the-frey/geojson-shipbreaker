# GeoJSON Shipbreaker

Example data is in the `data` folder, just unzip it. Results by default are placed in the `data/geojson` folder for UK OAs. Bear in mind the licence is the same as the UK Geoportal licence for this.

I might extend this with some more utility stuff, or I might not.

## Usage

Run via repl:

    lein repl

## License

See appropriate licences for UK Geodata, the code is MIT.
